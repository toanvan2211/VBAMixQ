# One way: This example uses the Randomize statement to initialize the random-number generator.
Because the number argument has been omitted, Randomize uses the return value from the Timer function as the new seed value.
Here is the code
{
Dim MyValue 
Randomize ' Initialize random-number generator. 
 
MyValue = Int((6 * Rnd) + 1) ' Generate random value between 1 and 6. 
}

# the orthe way
{
Int(lowerbound + Rnd * ( upperbound â€“ lowerbound + 1 ) )
}
